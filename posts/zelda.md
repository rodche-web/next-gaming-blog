The soundtrack has really grown since the NES days and there was never a tune playing that I didn't like, given I didn't play until the end, but it was still great to hear songs such as the Lost Woods, Kakariko Village and Hyrule Castle. The Lost Woods amused me even more because that area reappeared in Ocarina of Time and later on also in Twilight Princess, so it was funny to see that area, but with a completely different theme song and design.

I really liked the way they mark important locations for the main quest on your map, it was a nice way to guide me to the puzzles I was expected to participate in next without giving away too much. Navigating using the map was a lot of fun and quite often I had to find alternative routes to reach a certain area, which was a fun experience for me. If you really can't figure out what to do next and believe you have exhausted all other sources of information (aside from the internet) , you can always go to the fortune teller in order to learn what you shall do next.

Hyrule has gained a lot of detail since the original Zelda, once again we return to a top-down perspective, but there is just so much more to it. There are trees, interesting locations, villages, secret groves, and a lot of beautiful scenery to be found in Hyrule and its darker counterpart. It's also swell that they managed to keep the original's great timing when it had to switch to another screen, that was such a great feature and it is welcome to return. All by all, it is really obvious that A Link to the Past set a new standard for Super Nintendo games.

It is kind of cool to finally see the Golden Realm, or Darkworld as it is called now, after Ocarina of Time hyped it up big, but never showed us anything but the inside of the Chamber of Sages. The memorable theme song also helps to present this interesting world, a world full of history and years of Zelda games hyping it up. It is too bad to see it in such a bad shape, as it is foretold to be a paradise when the Triforce is touched by the right person, but you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.

The combat works so well and requires a lot of tactic. The major addition to the gameplay here is that Link can do a spin attack and walk diagonal, which gives us a lot of opportunity to experiment. Some of the enemies have shield which makes them hard to hit with just a stabbing move, others have spears and other arrows and there is even an enemy that is impossible to approach without getting a spiked ball in your face, so you will have to switch between weapons a lot and make clever use of scenery and cover to get out of the fights unharmed.

I was always psyched for the next boss-fight because they were just so interesting and there was no way to predict what was going to attack you. There was one moment where I fought my way up a huge tower only to find the item I needed guarded by a giant worm that was more than happy to push me off a platform and back to to another floor of the dungeon. The game was full of such moments, but Hyrule Castle was by far the most memorable dungeon in the entire game with an awesome boss-fight to top it all off.
